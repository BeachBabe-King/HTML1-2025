            <p>Friday night I'm thinking that we just might Fly away to someplace
                They don't know Who we are Now I'm riding shotgun in your car
                We drive through the city like explorers going sixty-five
                Blowing hair flying 'cross your face
                We left on Friday; now it's Saturday
                Pressed jeans, buttoned up Jeans ironed, slippin' up
                Red shoes, walkin' slow Headphones blarin' three stacks
                Sunglasses flarin' out Dick watch hangin' low
                Studded belt pulled taut Three stacks on the radio
                Friday night I'm thinking that we just might
                Run away to someplace we We can be who we are We can be who we are</p>
