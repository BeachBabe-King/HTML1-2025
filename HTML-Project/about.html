                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Founded in 1975 by Jessie Davis, Davisco Shipping was born during the golden age of
                        containerization. Inspired by Malcolm McLean's revolutionary shipping container innovations
                        of the 1950s, Davis saw an opportunity to improve container design and manufacturing.</p>

                    <p>Starting with a small facility in Barrie's Georgian Drive, Davisco focused
                        on building better, more secure containers. Our breakthrough came in 1978 with the invention of
                        the SecureLock‚Ñ¢ corner fitting system, which made loading and unloading 60% faster.</p>

                    <p>Today, Davisco Shipping containers can be found in ports around the world, from East to
                        West, carrying everything from electronics to food products. We're proud to be part of
                        the global trade network that connects the world.</p>
